        "\n",
        "ANSWER: --\n",
        "Interpreted languages (like Python) execute code line-by-line using an interpreter. They are platform-independent and easier to debug but can be slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages (like C/C++) translate the entire code into machine language before execution, resulting in faster performance but requiring a compilation step and platform-specific binaries.\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: --\n",
        "Exception handling is a mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors in a program. It helps prevent crashes and allows graceful recovery from unexpected conditions using try, except, finally, and else blocks.\n",

        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: --\n",

        "\n",
        "ANSWER: --\n",

        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: --\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used to clean up resources like open files or network connections, but relying on it is discouraged because garbage collection timing is not guaranteed.\n",
